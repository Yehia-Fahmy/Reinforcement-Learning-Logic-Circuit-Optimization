TODO: Add any additional initialization parameters for your heuristic

- didnt need anything additional

TODO: Implement your heuristic strategy to select a move

- kept a list of moves taken and the available moves
- sorted the moves by the largest_new_k
- chose the move with the lowest K value as our heuristic
- skips the move if the next move has a K larger than 6
- otherwise takes the move

TODO: Modify this function to run comprehensive tests.

- modified the function to take the appropriate parameters so that the sweep script would work
